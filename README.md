## reverse polish notation calculator

Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), which puts the operator before its operands.

_exemples:_

>5 3 + => 5+3 => 8


>6 2 /  => 6/2 => 3


> 5 2- 7+ => 10


> 7 5 2 -+ => 10


> 3 5 8 x 7 + x => 3x((5x8)+7) => 141


> 3 4 2 1+x+2/ => (3 + (4 x (2+1)))/2 => 7.5 


>1 2 + 4 × 5 + 3 − => ((1+2) x 4) + 5 - 3 => 14


In other way,


>3 5 4 1 2 + × + − => 5 + (4 x (1+2)) - 3
